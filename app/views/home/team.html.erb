        Dr. Oksenberg is the G.A. Zimmermann Endowed Chair in Neurology. As a native from Argentina, Dr. Oksenberg received his Ph.D. in Immunology from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel, and joined the UCSF
        faculty in 1993 following post-doctoral training at Stanford University. Since 1979 his research has focused in the areas of human immunogenetics and the control of the immune response. He has authored numerous
        publication and scholarly reviews in the field and is a leading investigator in the International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium.<br><a href="mailto:jorge.oksenberg@ucsf.edu">contact: jorge.oksenberg@ucsf.edu</a>

        My main research interest consists in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration. I obtained a PhD in Structural and Functional Genomics at the International School for Advanced Studies (Italy),
        where I studied the effects of prion infection on neuronal signaling under the supervision of Dr. Giuseppe Legname. In 2010, I joined the laboratory of Dr. Puneet Opal at Northwestern University, focusing my research
        efforts on the study of the polyglutamine disorder spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) and the rare pediatric disease giant axonal neuropathy (GAN). For my second postdoctoral experience, I joined in 2013 the Multiple
        Sclerosis Genetics Laboratory directed by Dr. Jorge Oksenberg at University of California San Francisco (UCSF) and, since then, I have been working on the functional characterization of the genome wide association study
        (GWAS) data generated in the lab. Additionally, I have been using cutting-edge genomic tools and mouse genetics to understand MS pathophysiology. In 2018, I have transitioned to an Assistant Adjunct Professor position,
        extending my research to the investigation of neurodegenerative processes in progressive MS.<br><a href="mailto:alessandro.didonna@ucsf.edu">contact: alessandro.didonna@ucsf.edu</a>
